  This document serves as comprehensive documentation for the \Verb|document.sty| package, a versatile \LaTeXe{} style file designed to streamline document creation with professional formatting and advanced features.
  The package integrates over 40 carefully selected \LaTeX{} packages, providing a unified interface for mathematics typesetting, theorem environments, code listings, bibliography management, and document structuring.
  
  Key features include: customizable headers and footers with formal and default styles; rich theorem-like environments (definition, theorem, lemma, corollary, proof, example, and more) with elegant colored boxes; comprehensive mathematics support through AMS packages, special symbols, and SI units; syntax-highlighted code listings for LaTeX and Python; professional table and figure formatting with captions and subcaptions; algorithm typesetting with pseudocode; flexible bibliography management via biblatex; and modular content organization with directory-based inclusion.
  
  The package offers several configurable options including theorem environment toggle, color scheme control, code listing support, font selection, header styles (default or formal), and bibliography styles.
  This documentation demonstrates all features through practical examples, including algorithm implementations, publication-quality tables, figure inclusion with TikZ graphics, and all available theorem-like environments.
