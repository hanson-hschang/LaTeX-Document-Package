  This document serves both as a template for creating \LaTeX{} documents and as a demonstration of the features provided by the \Verb|document.sty| package.
  The style file \Verb|document.sty|, written in \LaTeXe{}, imports necessary packages and defines the overall layout, formatting, and environments of the document.
  This document includes two main sections: ``Format'' and ``Environment''.
  The ``Format'' section describes the overall document structure, including the header and footer setup, hyperlink and reference management, citation and bibliography management, and the use of footnotes.
  The ``Environment'' section demonstrates various environments in \LaTeX{}, such as lists, quotes, and code formatting.
  The document is structured to include content from separate files, allowing for modular organization of the document.
  The document also includes an appendix section for additional content.
